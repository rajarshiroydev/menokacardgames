The migration was intentionally expand-only. It created the account lifecycle, nullable ownership keys, owner-local indexes, migration provenance and audit foundations. It did not assign ownership, create application accounts, alter historical results or relax the legacy global uniqueness constraints used by the current API.

Rollback for this development rehearsal is resetting the isolated Neon branch. Do not use a destructive down migration after owner-scoped writes exist. Production application requires separate authorization, a fresh backup/restore rehearsal and the coordinated cutover described in the feature plan.
